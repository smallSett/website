It doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down, what matters is how many times you get up.
You think I got where I am today by listening to what others say.
Remember to check your chin later.
What did you say happened to my mother?
All packed up.
Maybe I shouldn't have come wearing such nice pants.
Get ready for blood.
Don't default on your debt.
Only one person can get out.
Just talking is looking for trouble.
Attention everyone, a new champion is born.
Listen, if any of you survive, maybe I can find him a job.
Roar, you are a Noxian, just like my dad, I will try not to take it personally.</p></td>
